decided to register this local host since they were constant persistent and year to year always there 1997 
1995 IBM sold their computer interface and desktops to the US military. So BCI"s had to move along to other causes like MAC and WINDOWS but BROADCOM BRIGTHSIDE CA 
is the name of these haunting individuals, and what i mean to say is that they are always developing new ways to interfere with your own sub conscious
not a pretty thing when you have everything ahead of you to thrive in a career field of choice and sanity is amongst you. i hope my bit of code can help you 
disconnect those who dont have permission to acess your mind and body in full. i just began so maybe some more little things migth be 
needed look into it esc esc and press Y like 15 times youll see a list of commands
